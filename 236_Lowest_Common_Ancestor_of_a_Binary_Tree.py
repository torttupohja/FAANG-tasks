üß† How It Works:
If the current node is either p or q, return it.
Recursively search left and right subtrees.
If both p and q are found in different subtrees, the current node is their LCA.
If only one is found (in either left or right), propagate it upward.

‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree (since we visit each node once)
Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree (due to recursion stack)
