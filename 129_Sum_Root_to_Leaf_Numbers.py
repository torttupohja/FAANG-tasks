"""
üß† Explanation:
We traverse the tree in DFS fashion.
At each node, we multiply the current sum by 10 and add the node‚Äôs value.
When we reach a leaf node, we return the computed number.
We accumulate these numbers as we go back up the tree.

‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity:
Time: O(n) ‚Äî where n is the number of nodes (we visit each node once).
Space: O(h) ‚Äî height of the recursion stack.
O(log n) for a balanced tree
O(n) for a skewed tree
