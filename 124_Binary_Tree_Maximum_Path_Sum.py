"""
üß† Explanation:
Goal: Track the maximum path sum, considering:
The path may go through the current node and both children.
But when returning to the parent, we only take one child path (left or right).
We use dfs() to:
Compute max path starting from a node and going down.
Update max_sum if a larger total is found.

‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n) ‚Äî where n is the number of nodes.
Space Complexity: O(h) ‚Äî height of the tree (due to recursion).
O(log n) for balanced trees
O(n) for skewed trees
