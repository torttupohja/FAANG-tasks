"""
üß† Explanation:
Use a queue (BFS) to visit nodes level by level.
For each level, determine its size and process that many nodes.
Add each node's value to the current level list.
Append children to the queue for processing the next level.

‚è± Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in the tree.
Space Complexity: O(w), where w is the maximum width (maximum number of nodes at any level).
