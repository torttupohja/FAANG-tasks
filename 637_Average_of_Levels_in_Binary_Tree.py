üß† Explanation:
Perform level-order traversal (BFS) using a queue.
At each level:
Accumulate the sum of all node values.
Compute the average as level_sum / level_size.
Append the average to the result list.

‚è± Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the total number of nodes.
Space Complexity: O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree (number of nodes at the widest level).
